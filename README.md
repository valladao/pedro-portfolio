Hi, my name is Manoel Valladao and I am web developer. This project is a professional portfolio website that I create to my son, Pedro Henrique Valladao. My son is a talent music composer and artist so we want too much the best way to promote him works and project.

With that idea in mind, as Pedro is not only musician, but also likes to draw and paint, since boy, we decided that he would design the website. With some Figma lessons, he could design the album pages and sections so my work was to transport that to the web.

My plan was too use the most modern front-end technogies and to focus on performance and acessabilitiy. Here I explain a little bit of what has been developed and how.

## Dynamic Page Sections

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
